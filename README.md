This Java application is a classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game features a graphical user interface built with Java Swing, providing an intuitive and interactive gaming experience.

Turn-Based Gameplay: Players take turns marking empty spaces with their respective symbols ("X" or "O"), with the current player indicated at the top of the window.
